About the game...

Well, i made this game for my brother. He was aways playing it on my cell phone. Every time
when i wanted to make a call, the battery was empty (fuck! fuck! fuck! fuck! ... ). I became
very angry, i became mad with my brother... So i made my worm game! He stopped playing with 
my cell phone, fortunately. I written the game in Portuguese, so i´ve filled code with 
comments in English, translating things when possible. Sorry about my poor English!
